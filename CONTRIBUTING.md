# Contributing Guidelines

## Introduction
Welcome to the Veil project! We're thrilled that you're interested in contributing. Veil is a rendering library for Minecraft, with the goal of including more game-engine style features in the future. This project is created out of a love for coding and the desire to build something fun and useful. While we primarily develop Veil for our own use, we are more than happy for others to use it in their projects. However, please understand that Veil is not designed to be an "enterprise-level" library, and we will always prioritize our own goals and use cases.

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues
If you encounter any bugs or have suggestions for improvements, please open an issue. When reporting an issue, please provide as much detail as possible, including steps to reproduce the problem, your environment, and any relevant logs or screenshots.

### Pull Requests (PRs)
We welcome pull requests from the community! However, please note that we review and accept PRs at our discretion, based on how they fit with our vision and needs for Veil. Here are some guidelines to help your PR get accepted:

1. **Discuss First**: Before spending time on a major change, it's a good idea to open an issue to discuss your proposed changes. This helps ensure that your efforts align with the project's direction and goals.

2. **Fork the Repository**: Create a fork of the Veil repository and work on your changes in your fork. 

3. **Create a Branch**: Use a descriptive branch name for your changes, such as `feature/new-cool-feature` or `bugfix/fix-crash`.

4. **Write Clear Commit Messages**: Use clear and concise commit messages that explain the purpose of your changes.

5. **Follow Coding Standards**: Maintain the coding style and conventions used in the project. Consistent code helps with readability and maintenance.

6. **Test Your Changes**: Ensure that your changes do not break existing functionality. If possible, add tests for your new features or bug fixes.

7. **Submit Your PR**: Once your changes are ready, submit a pull request to the `main` branch of the Veil repository. Include a description of your changes and any relevant context or documentation.

### Code of Conduct
Please note that we expect all contributors to adhere to our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Respectful and constructive interactions are crucial for maintaining a positive and collaborative community.

## What to Expect
As maintainers, we review contributions based on our discretion and priorities. Here are a few things to keep in mind:

- **Internal Priorities**: Our own use cases and goals for Veil will always take precedence. While we appreciate community contributions, they must align with our internal needs.
- **Response Time**: We will do our best to review your issues and PRs in a timely manner, but please be patient as this is a passion project for us.
- **Feedback**: If we have feedback or requests for changes, we will communicate them through the issue or PR comments.
- **Acceptance**: Not all contributions will be accepted. We appreciate all efforts, but we reserve the right to decline contributions that do not align with our project's vision or standards.

## Thank You!
Thank you for your interest in contributing to Veil! Your contributions, whether large or small, help make this project better for everyone. We appreciate your support and understanding of our approach to managing this passion project.

Happy coding!
